# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the employee data to determine how many people will be eligible for retirement soon.  We determined how many employees would soon reach retirement age by looking at their birth dates.  The employees were then sorted to determine their titles so that management would be aware of what positions they may soon have to fill with new recruits.

## Results

**This image represents the retiring_titles table created to show a count of how many titles will soon be vacated by retiring employees.**

  - 41,380 employees will be eligible to retire in the near future.

  - A total of 90,398 individual positions will be vacated in the next few years as employees retire.  

  - However, those positions are spread out over only 7 titles – Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager.

  - A total of 1549 employees are eligible for the Mentorship opportunity.  These employees were born in 1965 and therefore could retire the soonest, but the company would like to offer them the opportunity to remain part time and mentor new recruits.

## Summary

Over 90,000 roles will need to be filled in the coming years as over 40,000 employees become eligible for retirement.  A turnover this large is likely to have an incredible impact, and it can only be hoped that not everyone will want to retire as soon as they are eligible.

Of those eligible to retire, 1549 qualify to serve as mentors.  If all these eligible employees choose to act as mentors to new hires, each person would need to mentor 58 people.  This number is a little unreasonable, and therefore if does not seem like there will be enough people to mentor new hires.  However, it is unlikely that all those who can retire will want to, and even more unlikely that it will happen all at once, so the mentor to new-hire ratio can hopefully be spaced out and be kept to a less overwhelming volume.  

Some additional queries would be helpful to learn more about the upcoming retirements.  A table showing how many people are leaving based on department would be helpful.  This would give managers in those departments more time to prepare for changes.  Also, a table that breaks down vacated positions by salary would be helpful.  This would give HR time to prepare hiring paperwork and help the C suite assess the bottom line.

Going forward, it is recommended that the company think about providing some incentives for employees to either delay or expediate retirement so that this new hiring period can be spaced out over a longer period of time.  This would reduce strain on those acting as mentors, as well as those doing the work of hiring employees.  This would also ensure that the next “silver tsunami” would not be as large as this one.
